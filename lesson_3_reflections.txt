When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  always? Better backup, better colaboration, multi device, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	could overwrite written code, colaboration, always use alll available ressources (e.g. functions, classes, etc.)
