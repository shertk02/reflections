Reflection 1
The old version was running
So we could see easily, what changes were made
And compare old and new, weather the replacement was sound or not

Reflection 2
Easier identify where parts didn't work anymore
easily revert to the best version, if you went into a dead end

Reflection 3:
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Con: User Error, unexpected crash, may lead to data loss
Pro: If done properly, much better overview, only relevant changes, easier to use

Reflection 4:
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Dependencies in software developement

Reflection 5:
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log to identify the versions I want to compare, diff to show the details of the change

Reflection 6:
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? 
There is always an easy fallback and not too much time and/or ressources are wasted

Reflection 7:
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I have no idea. I have to find out how to use git in an IDE like Android Studio
